					<p id="p1">Mental health problems are not new to this world, it has been present for a long time<br>
						and has been experienced by people in the past. This topic has been more talked about<br>
						now because it has greatly affected a lot of people. The pandemic is one of the biggest<br>
						reasons why the number of people experiencing this issue has greatly expanded. The isolation <br>
						and changes experienced by the world for the past two years have affected the mental health<br>
						of people. Students have experienced mental health problems because of the new <br>
						learning setup and adults have also experienced this issue because of the problems <br>
						brought on by the pandemic. </p>
					<p id="p2">Let us try to help the people experiencing these problems by being aware <br>
						and not invalidating their feelings. There are many organizations that<br>
						are doing their best to help people experiencing this issue, <br>
						let us try to also help them and be part of the change. </p>
